	This suggests that current forecasters should ensure that they give
	users an assessment of the uncertainty of their forecasts. We show
	how simple statistical methods can be combined with expert judgment
	to arrive at an overall predictive distribution for the future population.
	We apply the methods to a world population forecast that was made
	in 1994. Accepting that point forecast, we find that the probability
	is only about 2% that the world population in the year 2030 will
	be less than the low scenario of 8317 million. The probability that
	the world population will exceed the high scenario of 10736 million
	is about 13%. Similarly, the probability is only about 51% that the
	high-low interval of a recent United Nations (UN) forecast will contain
	the true population in the year 2025. Even if we consider the UN
	high-low intervals as conditional on the possible future policies
	of its member states, they appear to have a relatively small probability

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Estimating the total fertility rate is challenging for
	many developing countries because of limited data and varying data
	quality. A standardized, reproducible approach to produce estimates
	that include an uncertainty assessment is desired.
	
	METHODS We develop a method to estimate and assess uncertainty in
	the total fertility rate over time, based on multiple imperfect observations
	from different data sources including surveys and censuses. We take
	account of measurement error in observations by decomposing it into
	bias and variance and assess both by linear regression on a variety
	of data quality covariates. We estimate the total fertility rate
	using a local smoother, and assess uncertainty using the weighted
	likelihood bootstrap.
	
	RESULTS We apply our method to data from seven countries in West Africa
	and construct estimates and uncertainty intervals for the total fertility
	rate. Based on cross-validation exercises, we find that accounting
	for differences in data quality between observations gives better
	calibrated confidence intervals and reduces bias.
	
	CONCLUSIONS When working with multiple imperfect observations from
	different data sources to estimate the total fertility rate, or demographic
	indicators in general, potential biases and differences in error
	variance have to be taken into account to improve the estimates and
	their uncertainty assessment.},

  abstract = {We describe a Bayesian projection model to produce country-specific
	projections of the total fertility rate (TFR) for all countries.
	The model decomposes the evolution of TFR into three phases: pre-transition
	high fertility, the fertility transition, and post-transition low
	fertility. The model for the fertility decline builds on the United
	Nations Population Divisionâ€™s current deterministic projection
	methodology, which assumes that fertility will eventually fall below
	replacement level. It models the decline in TFR as the sum of two
	logistic functions that depend on the current TFR level, and a random
	term. A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to project future TFR
	based on both the countryâ€™s TFR history and the pattern of all
	countries. It is estimated from United Nations estimates of past
	TFR in all countries using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
	The post-transition low fertility phase is modeled using an autoregressive
	model, in which long-term TFR projections converge toward and oscillate
	around replacement level. The method is evaluated using out-of-sample
	projections for the period since 1980 and the period since 1995,

  abstract = {The binned probability ensemble (BPE) technique is presented as a
	method for producing forecasts of the probability distribution of
	a variable using an ensemble of numerical model integrations. The
	ensemble forecasts are used to partition the real line into a number
	of bins, each of which has an equal probability of containing the
	“true” forecast. The method is tested for both a simple low-order
	dynamical system and a general circulation model (GCM) forced with
	observed sea surface temperatures (an ensemble of Atmospheric Model
	Intercomparison Project integrations). The BPE method can also be
	used to calculate the probability that probabilistic ensemble forecasts
	are consistent with the verifying observations. The method is not
	sensitive to the fact that the characteristics of the forecast probability
	distribution may change drastically for different initial condition
	(or boundary condition) probability distributions. For example, the
	method is capable of evaluating whether the variance of a set of
	ensemble forecasts is consistent with the verifying observed variance.
	Applying the method to the ensemble of boundary-forced GCM integrations
	demonstrates that the GCM produces probabilistic forecasts with too
	little variability for upper-level dynamical fields. Operational
	weather prediction centers including the U.K. Meteorological Office,
	the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts, and the National
	Centers for Environmental Prediction have been applying this method,
	referred to by them as Talagrand diagrams, to the verification of
	operational ensemble predictions. The BPE method only evaluates the
	consistency of ensemble predictions and observations and should be
	used in conjunction with additional verification tools to provide
	a complete assessment of a set of probabilistic forecasts.},

	- Aim is to estimate survival probabilities from ring-recovery data.
	
	- Incorporate random effects: survival ~ A + Y + E where 'A' are fixed
	age effects, 'Y' is a random effect for year and 'E' is a N(0,sig_e^2)
	random variable to provide extra-binomial variation.
	
	- Esimtation is by Gibbs sampling.
	
	- All models fitted here are identifiable.
	
	
	*APPLICATION*
	
	- Use ring-recovery for British lapwings as discussed in Besbeas et
	al. (2002).
	
	- Priors chosen to be non-informative:
	
	-- Age effects ~ N(0, var=5).
	
	-- sigma_y^2 ~ unif(0, 100); variance for the random year effects.
	
	-- sigma_e^2 ~ unif(0, 100); variance for the extra-binomial variation.
	
	-- lambda ~ unif(0,1); probability that a marked bird will be reported
	when dead.
	
	- Choose to use only two age classes: first year of live and adult.
	
	- Use Bayesian p-values to asses model fit. Select model survival
	~ A + E, where A has only two levels.
	
	
	*PREDICTION*
	
	- Total population trajectories for 300 years are simulated from the
	posterior of survival probabilities by assuming that exactly 100
	birds are born each year.
	
	- Population appears to reach a steady state.

	*COVARIATES*
	
	- Effect for weather added and estimated in the same way.
	
	
	*MODEL SELECTION*
	
	- This is tricky for random effects models. For e.g., to calculate
	AIC, how many parameters are there?

	prior is specified by two quantiles but a normal and Cauchy are both

	- One problem with non-informative priors is that they are not unique

	---- MAXIMUM ENTROPY PRIORS ----
	
	- Choose prior to maximize the entropy subject to constraints on moments
	or quatiles.
	
	
	---- USING THE MARGINAL TO DETERMINE THE PRIOR ----
	
	- Empirical Bayes approach.
	
	- Without knowledge of prior parameter, can only make subjective judgements
	about the observable quantities, hence should use the marginal distn
	of the data to help determine the prior.
	
	
	---- CRITICISMS [of Bayesian Inference] (p.109) ----

	- Analysis of harvest data allows estimation of populations over a

	*DATA*
	
	- Wings from sage grouse hunted in Oregon between 1993 and 2005 were
	classified as "young" (<= 1yr old) or "adult" (> 1 yr old).
	
	- Survey of hunters gathering information about hunting success. Response
	rates averaged 67 percent.
	
	- Population index: average number of males per lek (an elevated piece
	of grassland).
	
	- Radiotelemetry data collected in 1998--2001; provided an independent
	estimate of harvest rates.
	
	
	*MODEL*
	
	- Joint likelihood formed as product of
	
	-- Harvest likelihoods: number of harvested (and reported) birds in
	each year of each age-sex class multinomial with probabilities equal
	to the proportion of birds in each age-sex class in the population.
	This is overdetermined, hence the use of auxillary data.
	
	-- Total harvest count in each year modeled as a binomial random variable
	parameterized by hunter effort.
	
	-- Auxillary likelihooods based on the lek-count indices and radiotelemtry
	data: binomial and normal.
	
	- Adult abundances estimated resursively by introducing age-sex specific
	survival proportion parameters constrained to be constant over time.
	
	- Used chi-square goodness of fit on harvest data to assess whether
	or not both sets of auxillary data necessary.
	
	- Used AIC to select among models for the same dataset.
	
	
	*RESULTS*
	
	- Lek-count index data reduced goodness of fit, hence were used to
	independently validate model abundance estimates.
	
	- Was a large degree of imprecision in the estimates; coefficients
	of variation for parameters were, on average, higher than recommended
	for successful management.},

	- Provides a review and summary of methods used by Brooks, Catchpole,
	Morgan \& Co. in all their mark-recapture studies.
	
	- Also provides many references for Bayesian estimation in this model.
	
	
	*BAND-RETURN MODELS*
	
	- Likelihood model for band return models described:
	
	-- Parameters are survival in first year of life, survival after first
	year of life and reporting probability.
	
	-- Models labeled in x/y/z format to describe how each parameter depends
	on age "A", time "T" or is constant "C". E.g., T/A/T means 0-1 yr
	old survival and reporting prob dependent on time, adult survival
	prob dependent on age.
	
	-- Number of marked animals recovered when dead is a product of multinomial
	likelihoods.
	
	- Priors on all parameters are betas, since the parameters are all
	probabilities.
	
	- Sensitivity to choice of prior:
	
	-- By fitting the C/C/T model to some blue-winged teal data as an
	example, it is shown that choice of prior can have a significant
	effect on posterior parameter estimates for parameters for which
	there is little data, e.g., the survival probabilities at old ages.
	Importantly, changing the prior on reporting probabilities can influence
	posterior estimates of survival probabilities since they must be
	adjusted to match the data.
	
	-- Fitting the T/A/T model to the same data reveals sensitivity to
	the priors on the survival probabilties as well.
	
	- Posterior model probabilities are used to asses adequacy of various
	models. It is noted that these should be computed under a range of
	priors. There is an implicit penalty for many parameters built into
	the calculation of posterior model probabilities, while no such penalty
	is present in the calculation of Bayesian p-values. Hence, these
	two methods can lead to different model suggestions.
	
	
	*OPEN POPULATION CAPTURE-RECAPTURE MODELS*
	
	- In this design, adult animals are captured, marked and released.
	Captures are made at subsequent times and the number of already marked
	animals is recorded and the rest are marked for the first time. All
	are released and the procedure is repeated.
	
	- Probabilities of survival, probabilities of recapture and total
	population size can be estimated with appropriate models.
	
	- Beta priors are suggested, as for the band-return design.
	
	
	*DISCUSSION*
	
	- Need to be careful selecting priors: could use empirical priors
	based on data.},

	- Extends and corrects Vounatsou \& Smith (1995) (VS95).
	
	
	*MODELS*
	
	- Notation: x/y/z describes the model for first-year survival, adult
	survival and reporting probability. Can be age dependent ("A"), time
	dependent ("T") or constant ("C"). VS95 considered C/A/C.
	
	- C/A/C model has a ridge in the likelihood with known location. Unique
	MLEs do not exist but Bayesian estimates (even using flat priors)
	do exist.
	
	
	*HERRING GULL DATA*
	
	- Influence of prior:
	
	-- VS95 only tried different priors for lambda, the reporting probability.
	
	-- This paper tries different priors for other parameters, varying
	them independently. Should probably impose some dependence based
	on subject matter knowledge. E.g., survival ing first year of life
	should be lower than in later years.
	
	-- VS95 used U(0,1) priors for all survival probabilities. However,
	using beta(4,2) and beta(20,5) priors resulted in different posterior
	inferences. [Although this is to be expected since, for survival
	at very old ages there is no data, so the posterior is essentially
	just the prior].
	
	-- Suggest using random effects to capture individual-level variation
	in survival among adult birds.
	
	- Band loss:
	
	-- Should account for the loss of bands over time.
	
	
	*MALLARD DATA*
	
	- Influence of prior:
	
	-- VS95 used T/A/C model. When checked with beta(20,5) prior for adult
	survival seems that this model no longer sensible.
	
	- Goodness of fit:
	
	-- Used Bayesian p-values. Seems like none of the model/prior combinations
	tested fit particularly well. Authors suggest looking at posterior
	model probabilities.
	
	
	*LIKELIHOOD RIDGE FOR C/A/C MODEL*
	
	- Ridge in likelihood located. ... Don't really understand how they
	do this. See Carlin \& Louis text maybe?
	
	- Point made is that there is a ridge in the likelihood surface in
	the C/A/C model. Using results from Catchpole \& Morgan (1994) and
	earlier work, they locate this ridge in parameter space and claim
	that, despite the non-uniqueness of MLEs, Bayesian estimates do exist.
	Moreover, the estimated standard error of these estimates are small.
	This is because the posterior is defined, whether or not the likelihood
	is flat. However, in this case there is great sensitivity to the
	prior since the likelihood contains little to no information about
	the parameters, so inference should proceed with caution.},

	Often there is no explainable structure to the temporal variation

	is treated as random with average value E( 2 ) = 2 . This random

	include point and interval estimation for process variation, 2 ,
	estimation of E(S) and var((S)) where the latter includes a component

	the random effects model leads to shrinkage estimates, S i , as improved

  abstract = {Age structure proportions (proportion of harvested individuals within
	each age class) are commonly used as support for regulatory restrictions
	and input for deer population models. Such use requires critical
	evaluation when harvest regulations force hunters to selectively
	harvest specific age classes, due to impact on the underlying population
	age structure. We used a stochastic population simulation model to
	evaluate the impact of using harvest proportions to evaluate changes
	in population age structure under a selective harvest management
	program at two scales. Using harvest proportions to parameterize
	the age-specific harvest segment of the model for the local scale
	showed that predictions of post-harvest age structure did not vary
	dependent upon whether selective harvest criteria were in use or
	not. At the county scale, yearling frequency in the post-harvest
	population increased, but model predictions indicated that post-harvest
	population size of 2.5 years old males would decline below levels
	found before implementation of the antler restriction, reducing the
	number of individuals recruited into older age classes. Across the
	range of age-specific harvest rates modeled, our simulation predicted
	that underestimation of age-specific harvest rates has considerable
	influence on predictions of post-harvest population age structure.
	We found that the consequence of uncertainty in harvest rates corresponds
	to uncertainty in predictions of residual population structure, and
	this correspondence is proportional to scale. Our simulations also
	indicate that regardless of use of harvest proportions or harvest
	rates, at either the local or county scale the modeled SHC had a
	high probability (>0.60 and >0.75, respectively) of eliminating recruitment
	into >2.5 years old age classes. Although frequently used to increase
	population age structure, our modeling indicated that selective harvest
	criteria can decrease or eliminate the number of white-tailed deer
	recruited into older age classes. Thus, we suggest that using harvest
	proportions for management planning and evaluation should be viewed
	with caution. In addition, we recommend that managers focus more
	attention on estimation of age-specific harvest rates, and modeling
	approaches which combine harvest rates with information from harvested
	individuals to further increase their ability to effectively manage
	deer populations under selective harvest programs.},

	age-structured harvest data. These data represent finite realizations
	of stochastic demographic and sampling processes and have long been
	used by biologists to infer population trends. However, different
	sources of data have been combined in ad hoc ways and these methods
	usually failed to incorporate sampling error. In this article, we
	propose a ``hidden process{''} (or state-space) model for estimating
	abundance, survival, recovery rate, and recruitment from age-at-harvest
	data that incorporate both demographic and sampling stochasticity.
	To this end, a likelihood for age-at-harvest data is developed by
	embedding a population dynamics model within a model for the sampling
	process. Under this framework, the identification of abundance parameters
	can be achieved by conducting a joint analysis with an auxiliary
	data set. We illustrate this approach by conducting a Bayesian analysis
	of age-at-harvest and mark-recovery data from black bears (Ursus
	americanus) in Pennsylvania. Using a set of reasonable prior distributions,
	we demonstrate a substantial increase in precision when posterior
	summaries of abundance are compared to a bias-corrected Lincoln-Petersen
	estimator. Because demographic processes link consecutive abundance
	estimates, we also obtain a more realistic biological picture of
	annual changes in abundance. Because age-at-harvest data are often
	readily obtained, we argue that this type of analysis provides a

	- Application to black bear population in Pennsylvania, 1986--1999.
	Females only. Closed: no migration.
	
	- Age, class and sex of harvested animals often recorded; useful to
	build models that require this data. However, often also need auxillary
	data, e.g., from population surveys using mark-recapture, aerial
	survey or radiotelemetry methods.
	
	- Previous methods based on mulitnomial models with number at start
	time as an "index" (p.1171Ai), probabilities incorporating survival
	and harvest rates. Difficult to incorporate fertility, and open ended
	age group and random effects with this model.
	
	- Model abundance and harvest counts jointly as a Markov process;
	essentially the same as CCMP projection.
	
	-- Inputs: age-time specific harvest counts; mark-recapture data
	
	-- Structure: Let N_{a,t} be age-time spec abundance, S_{a,t} be surv
	probability cond on being alive at time t; h_{a,t} be harvest prob
	cond on being alive at t, f_{a,t} be fertility; C_{a,t} be age-time
	spec harvest count; M, H, t_k, I_k be mark-recapture data, A be oldest
	age, T be end-point of study. Then Likelihood used is L(C|N,h)*L(N|N_1,S,f);
	i.e., likelihood of harvest given abundance and harvest prob * likelihood
	of abundance given population at baseline (N_1), non-hunted survival
	and fertility. Mark recapture data are used to estimate N_1.
	
	-- Recruitment, i.e., births, modelled as Poisson.
	
	-- Abundance counts and harvest counts modelled as multinomial.
	
	-- Data are: C_{a,t} and mark-recapture data.
	
	-- S_{a,t} and h_{a,t} are modelled on the logit scale, f_{a,t} on
	the log scale.
	
	-- Parsimonious parameterizations of S_{a,t}, h_{a,t} and f_{a,t}
	are used; model selection is used to choose between various parameterizations.
	
	- Estimation: Bayesian formulation.
	
	-- Uniform prior for baseline counts on absolute scale
	
	-- Normal priors for random effect and fixed effect parameters (i.e.,
	those use to model S_{a,t}, h_{a,t} and f_{a,t})
	
	-- Gamma hyper-priors on precisions.

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a strategy for analysing recovery data from
	birds ringed as nestlings. The approach advocated starts with a global
	model, involving calendar year dependence of both reporting and first-year
	survival rates, and age-dependence of survival rates for older birds.
	Likelihood ratio tests are then used to choose between a range of
	submodels. The strategy is illustrated through application to three
	data sets, on mallards, herring gulls, and blue-winged teal. The
	effect of age-dependence operating also on reporting rates is examined
	through matched simulations, since a model with age-dependent reporting
	rates cannot be fitted directly. This reveals an underestimation
	of the first-year survival rates, when the probability of recovery
	for first-year birds is greater than that for older birds. It is
	argued that this bias may not be serious and indeed may be allowed
	for in practice. For mallards and teal, comparisons are drawn with
	the results from other models that additionally analyse recoveries
	of birds ringed as adults; the same general conclusions are reached.},

  number = {470},
  abstract = {Elicitation is a key task for subjectivist Bayesians. Although skeptics
	hold that elicitation cannot (or perhaps should not) be done, in
	practice it brings statisticians closer to their clients and subject-matter
	expert colleagues. This article reviews the state of the art, reflecting
	the experience of statisticians informed by the fruits of a long
	line of psychological research into how people represent uncertain
	information cognitively and how they respond to questions about that
	information. In a discussion of the elicitation process, the first
	issue to address is what it means for an elicitation to be successful;
	that is, what criteria should be used. Our answer is that a successful
	elicitation faithfully represents the opinion of the person being
	elicited. It is not necessarily "true" in some objectivistic sense,
	and cannot be judged in that way. We see that elicitation as simply
	part of the process of statistical modeling. Indeed, in a hierarchical
	model at which point the likelihood ends and the prior begins is
	ambiguous. Thus the same kinds of judgment that inform statistical
	modeling in general also inform elicitation of prior distributions.
	The psychological literature suggests that people are prone to certain
	heuristics and biases in how they respond to situations involving
	uncertainty. As a result, some of the ways of asking questions about
	uncertain quantities are preferable to others, and appear to be more
	reliable. However, data are lacking on exactly how well the various
	methods work, because it is unclear, other than by asking using an
	elicitation method, just what the person believes. Consequently,
	one is reduced to indirect means of assessing elicitation methods.
	The tool chest of methods is growing. Historically, the first methods
	involved choosing hyperparameters using conjugate prior families,
	at a time when these were the only families for which posterior distributions
	could be computed. Modern computational methods, such as Markov chain
	Monte Carlo, have freed elicitation from this constraint. As a result,
	now both parametric and nonparametric methods are available for low-dimensional
	problems. High-dimensional problems are probably best thought of
	as lacking another hierarchical level, which has the effect of reducing
	the as-yet-unelicited parameter space. Special considerations apply
	to the elicitation of group opinions. Informal methods, such as Delphi,
	encourage the participants to discuss the issue in the hope of reaching
	consensus. Formal methods, such as weighted averages or logarithmic
	opinion pools, each have mathematical characteristics that are uncomfortable.
	Finally, there is the question of what a group opinion even means,
	because it is not necessarily the opinion of any participant.},

	experiments are cast into a Bayesian framework using a @'noninformative@'
	discrete uniform improper prior (a priori theoretical) distribution.
	Some properties of the posterior distribution (probability of each
	population size given the data) are briefly and informally discussed
	(inference, convergence, mean, mode, median, and treatment of nuisance
	parameters). A sequential Bayes computational algorithm, suitable
	for microcomputers, is given. Several examples are presented as a
	practical guide to computing estimates. For relatively small sample
	sizes, the Bayesian approach yields larger mean abundance estimates
	than traditional methods. There is little difference in these estimates
	for larger sampling efforts. Advantages of the approach include the
	following: the probability of observing the data at all feasible
	population sizes is calculated exactly; the method works for all
	cases regardless of sample size or sampling procedure; a plot of
	successive posterior distributions can be used as a visual diagnostic
	of conformity with basic assumptions; and finally, inferences can

	Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed

	The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines
	its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov
	random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an
	MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural
	mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics
	of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring,
	nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the
	posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image
	model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another
	(imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the
	physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what
	is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution.
	The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the
	maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded
	observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm
	for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm
	and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations

  abstract = {Summary.? Probabilistic forecasts of continuous variables take the
	form of predictive densities or predictive cumulative distribution
	functions. We propose a diagnostic approach to the evaluation of
	predictive performance that is based on the paradigm of maximizing
	the sharpness of the predictive distributions subject to calibration.
	Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the distributional
	forecasts and the observations and is a joint property of the predictions
	and the events that materialize. Sharpness refers to the concentration
	of the predictive distributions and is a property of the forecasts
	only. A simple theoretical framework allows us to distinguish between
	probabilistic calibration, exceedance calibration and marginal calibration.
	We propose and study tools for checking calibration and sharpness,
	among them the probability integral transform histogram, marginal
	calibration plots, the sharpness diagram and proper scoring rules.
	The diagnostic approach is illustrated by an assessment and ranking
	of probabilistic forecasts of wind speed at the Stateline wind energy
	centre in the US Pacific Northwest. In combination with cross-validation
	or in the time series context, our proposal provides very general,
	nonparametric alternatives to the use of information criteria for
	model diagnostics and model selection.},

	- Famine related mortality estimated in two ways
	
	-- 1) Govt estimates of CDR for 1995 and 1998.
	
	-- 2) Interviews of famine refugees who crossed border to China.
	
	
	*METHOD USING GOVT CDR ESTS*
	
	- Used "Demographic Projection Software" from USBC (p.226) to change
	CDR into number of deaths.
	
	- Took 1995 and 1998 Govt CDR estimates as pre- and post- famine estimates,
	resp.
	
	- Used age-specific mortality patterns from the Chinese famine of
	1958--1961 to apportion CDR to age grous.
	
	- Excess deaths calculated as difference between expected deaths if
	1993 mortality continued through period (with some decline) and estimated
	mortality.

	- Khmer Rouge period was April 1975--January 1979. Number of excess
	deaths attributed to this period is disputed.
	
	
	*PREVIOUS ESTIMATES OF EXCESS DEATHS*
	
	- Use a sample, e.g., grave excavations or interviews with witnesses,
	and extrapolate to whole population. Typically yields high estimates.
	
	- Use demographic accounting to reconstruct population and estimate
	excess mortality. Yielded lower estimates.
	
	- Problems: Uncertainty NOT accounted for; used 1980 census which
	is unreliable.
	
	
	*NEW APPROACH*
	
	- Goals: Use new data: UN electoral registration 1982 (broken down
	by single year ages, p.53); produce range estimates, not just point
	estimates; analyse different causes of deaths.
	
	- Inputs: Estimates of population by age and sex at two different
	times, age-specific estimates of fertility, normal mortality and
	net int'l migration.
	
	- Outputs: Estimated excess mortality, due to violent causes and deterioration
	in living conditions. Only for those born before 1970 (p.52).
	
	- Method: Reconstruct population in the inter-censal interval using
	vital rates and attribute difference at terminal census to excess
	mortality. Decompose excess mortality by age-structure (young adult
	males more likely to die through violence).
	
	- More method details:
	
	-- Want reference period to be 1970--1992 but pop estimates are 1962
	and 1992. Project 1962 forward to 1970 and 1992 backward [how?!]
	to 1970. Use a range of vital rates to get a range of 1980 and 1970
	populations (scenario method).
	
	-- Mortality trend from 1962--1970 assumed to continue through 1970--1980
	period. This used to estimate the normal level of mortality, or what
	would have been expected without Khmer Rounge.
	
	
	*RESULTS*
	
	- Estimates of excess mortality high: 1.2--3.4 million more deaths.
	
	- Migration greatest source of uncertainty due to poor data.
	
	
	*NOTES ON MIGRATION*
	
	- Various sources cited which provide a range of migration estimates,
	broken down by source/destination.
	
	
	*NOTES*
	
	- Range of estimates is huge.
	
	- No quantification of uncertainty.},

	present the first quantitative evidence to date that attests to a
	one-third decline offertility during this regime, followed by a substantial
	"baby boom " after the fall of the KR. Further analyses reveal that
	the fertility rebound was produced not only by a two-year marriage
	bubble but also by a surge in marital fertility that remained for
	nearly a decade above its precrisis level. Our results illustrate
	the potential influence of mortality on fertility, which may be more
	difficult to identify for more gradual mortality declines. To the

	fertil patterns, our findings also reinforce recent qualifications

	*DERIVATION OF CIs (Appendix 2)*
	
	- Uses binomial model of life-table. This assumes that the survival
	probabilities are correct (no overdispersion) and models the number
	of survivors in a cohort exposed to the life-table as a binomial
	r.v. For successive age groups, no. alive at beginning are number
	of trials, probability of survival are the p s from the life table.
	
	- Approximates binomial distn with a Normal distribution.
	
	- Variance of estd net number of migrants comes from the deterministic
	relationship between the projected population (which is treated as
	random) and the population in the terminal census. Census counts
	are error free and non-random.
	
	- Variance of number in oldest age group is a weighted sum of variances
	of number of survivors from all groups that could have contributed
	to the oldest age group.},

	are to be made. A popular stochastic method that solves this problem
	is kriging. But the appropriateness of kriging--and, for that matter,
	of any method based on probabilistic models for spatial data--has
	been frequently questioned. A number of nonstochastic methods have
	also been proposed, the leading contender of which appears to be
	splines. There has been some debate as to which of kriging and splines
	is better--a debate that has centered largely on operational issues,
	because the two methods are based on different models for the process.
	In this article the debate is turned to where it ultimately matters--namely,
	the precision of prediction based on real data. By dividing data
	sets into modeling sets and prediction sets, the two methods may
	be compared. In the cases examined, kriging sometimes outperforms
	splines by a considerable margin, and it never performs worse than

  abstract = {To develop high-low bounds for population projections, traditional
	demographic forecasts assume fertility is always high or always low.
	Such bounds are related to bounds on average annual fertility up
	to year t rather than to individual year bounds in time series forecasts,
	and so the autocorrelation of time series forecast errors is important
	in practical applications. This paper develops methods for using
	time series methods to make constrained long term forecasts of fertility.
	Specifically, age-time variations in fertility are modeled with a
	single time-varying parameter, or fertility index; upper and lower
	bounds on the total fertility rate are imposed by forecasting an
	inverse logistic transform of the fertility index; the long run level
	of the fertility forecast is also constrained to equal a prespecified
	level. The principal interest is in the variance and the autocorrelation
	structure of the forecast errors. Based on these for the USA we conclude:
	(1) the probability interval for average fertility up to time t begins
	to contract after about 50 years, but only very slightly: (2) the
	probability interval for average fertility up to year 2065 is about
	three-fifths as wide as that for single year fertility in 2065, but
	is still far wider than the band for official forecasts; (3) realizations
	of the simple ARMA (1,0,1) forecast model exhibit long fluctuations
	something like actual fertility in industrial nations; (4) the model
	of fertility age patterns fits poorly at older ages, but may be adequate
	for present purposes.},

	long historical series of births and deaths to produce estimates

	While inverse projection requires extraneous information on population
	size at scattered dates, back projection does not. In this paper
	I argue that back projection attempts an impossible task, and can
	only arbitrarily select one demographic past from among an infinite
	set of equally plausible and acceptable ones, which are also consistent
	with the input data. Inverse projection, on the other hand, is more
	modest in its goal, but is robust and straightforward. In an important
	and outstanding book, Wrigley and Schofield use back projection to
	reconstruct English demographic history from 1539 to 1871. In this
	paper, inverse projection is used to replicate their reconstruction
	under assumptions that are in important respects weaker, although
	these estimates are contingent on independent population size estimates
	for 1541 and 1696. The results buttress Wrigley and Schofield's reconstruction.
	However, it is argued that their data and reconstruction cannot offer
	independent evidence for the general levels of population before
	the mid-eighteenth century; rather, they help us to interpolate among
	benchmarks for which we have extraneous evidence, and contingent
	on these benchmarks, fill in the rich details of the demographic

	- Aim is to estimate population size in a closed population in which

	*BEHAVIOR RESPONSE MODEL*
	
	- With a total population size of N, the probability that each member
	is caught over t captures is the product of Bernoulli probabilities.
	
	
	- Probability of capture for each animal on each occasion decomposed
	into probabilities for animals that have and have not been previously
	caught.
	
	- Beta priors put on these probabilities, Jeffrey's prior put on N

  abstract = {Demographic analyses of age-structured populations typically rely
	on life history data for individuals, or when individual animals
	are not identified, on information about the numbers of individuals
	in each age class through time. While it is usually difficult to
	determine the age class of a randomly encountered individual, it
	is often the case that the individual can be readily and reliably
	assigned to one of a set of age classes. For example, it is often
	possible to distinguish first-year from older birds. In such cases,
	the population age structure can be regarded as a latent variable
	governed by a process prior, and the data as summaries of this latent
	structure. In this article, we consider the problem of uncovering
	the latent structure and estimating process parameters from summaries
	of age class information. We present a demographic analysis for the
	critically endangered migratory population of whooping cranes (Grus
	americana), based only on counts of first-year birds and of older
	birds. We estimate age and year-specific survival rates. We address
	the controversial issue of whether management action on the breeding
	grounds has influenced recruitment, relating recruitment rates to
	the number of seventh-year and older birds, and examining the pattern

  review = {*INTRODUCTION*
	
	- Often cannot estimate ages from observeations in wild. Best can
	do is often crude classes such as juvenile/adult.
	
	- However, more detailed age structure often highly desirable.
	
	
	*APPLICATION*
	
	- Whooping Cranes which are highly endangered; only one migratory
	population of a few hundred birds.
	
	- Aim is to reconstruct detailed population age structure from aggregate
	data only.
	
	
	*MODEL*
	
	- Six closed age-groups and one open ended age group.
	
	- Number of birds age x in year t is bin(n_{x-1,t-1}, s_{x,t}).
	
	- Recruitment (births) accounted for by assuming n_{1,t} ~ Poisson(f_t
	* n_{x_(7),t}). n_{x_(7),t} is an 'index' of the number of breeders.
	
	- Model is a cohort component model with no migration and fertility
	restricted to the open ended age group. Moreover, there are only
	6 s_{x,t} parameters per year; s_{x_(6),t} gives survival into the
	open ended group from both the last closed age group and the open
	ended group itself. The age structures at times throughout the interval
	are modeled as a Markov process with transition probabilities functions
	of the survival and recruitment parameters.
	
	- Model is overparameterized so:
	
	-- Survival is modeled as: logit(s_{xt}) = alpha_t + beta_x; alpha_t
	~ N(0, 1/tau_s), beta_x ~ N(0, 1/0.4).
	
	-- Recruitment is modeled as log(f_t) = a_0 + a_1 + b*(t -32) + epsilon_t;
	epsilon_t ~ N(0, 1/tau_f).
	
	- Hyper-priors:
	
	-- psi = (a_0, a_1, b, tau_f, tau_s) propto (1/tau_s)(1/tau_f)
	
	- Priors:
	
	-- Improper uniform prior set on (Y_1 | B_1, W_1).
	
	
	*ESTIMATION*
	
	- Let B_t and W_t be the number of 'brown' aka juvenile and 'white'
	aka non-juvenile birds in year t.
	
	- Estimation is via the posterior distribution of {(Y_t, theta | B_t,
	W_t); t = 1, ..., n} where theta is the vector with all survival
	and recruitment parameters. The parameters a_0, a_1, b, tau_s, tau_f
	are integrated over, so estimates are marginal wrt these parameters.
	
	- M-H sampler used to update vital rate parameters and associated
	hyp-priors.
	
	- Updates to {Y_t} done with M-H but generation of candidates quite
	involved as the model imposes several range restrictions. E.g., no
	immigration, so Y_{x,t}, x > 1, cannot be bigger than Y_{x-1,t-1};
	i.e., cohorts can only grow through births into the youngest age
	group. This procedure seems rather time intensive.
	
	
	*MODEL SELECTION*
	
	- DIC and scientific reasoning were used to choose among various models
	for fertility and survival. They differed depending on whether or
	not random variation was included for fertility and survival; whether
	or not trends were present in fertility; effects of egg manipulation;
	restrictions on how survival can vary with age.},

	- Estimate annual life tables and annual populations for China, 1953--1982.

	*CONTEXT*
	
	- Reliable data and high quality estimates of fertility for this period
	exist.
	
	- Reliable data on migration not available, probably never will be.
	
	- Only estimate of annual life tables for this period not sex-specific
	and not a good fit to data.
	
	
	*DATA*
	
	- No published counts of deaths by age and sex or annual age structures.
	
	- Used two censuses and annual age-specific fertility rates to infer
	inter-censal life tables.
	
	
	*METHODOLOGY*
	
	- Treat as a closed population (migration == 0) (p.69)
	
	- CCMP gives relationships between N(t), N(t+1), F(x, t), B(t), D(t)
	and S(x, t) which is underdetermined: can be solved for S(x,t) but
	no unique solution. Can make unique if we know the age-pattern of
	mortality.
	
	- Need to find best pattern of mortality: Two existing methods of
	estimating intercensal survival ratios from two censuses and total
	number of intercensal births (Preston's and Coale's), plus one new
	one proposed here.
	
	-- They differ in the way they estimate number of person-years lived
	by age (p.83).
	
	- Each method is tested on simulated populations, using 1953 Chines
	population as base and simulating population 11 years into the future:
	
	-- 1) Coale & Demeny West level 16 mod lt and 12 million births
	
	-- 2) Same as (1) but decrease size of 20--29 cohort and switch life
	table and no. of births after 6 years of projection (similar to what
	actually happened in China).
	
	-- 3) Same but further perturbations to represent undercount, for
	example. (p.90).
	
	- Compares methods by looking at dissimilarity between projected age-distribution
	and terminal census. Uses Mitra's (1983) measure.
	
	- Method of fitting model life table seems to be trial and error;

	- Estimate correction factors for vital registration and census counts

	- Use these to infer coverage of census and registration.
	
	
	METHOD
	
	- Uses the "consistent correction" method developed in earlier papers
	and previously applied to migration in Sri Lanka.
	
	- Based on setting preliminary correction factors for counts of births,
	deaths and population and then modifying them by combining all three
	via CCMP (I think).
	
	- The modified correction factors are those that are "closest" to
	the preliminary correction factors [in Euclidean space?].
	
	
	- Preliminary correction factors for birth counts were taken from
	other sources.
	
	- Preliminary correction factors for census counts were mainly taken
	from other sources.
	
	- Preliminary correction factors for death counts were based on Coale-Demeny
	model North and the preliminarily corrected census counts. Thus,
	these should NOT be used as inputs.

  abstract = {Scientific advice to fishery managers needs to be expressed in probabilistic
	terms to convey uncertainty about the consequences of alternative
	harvesting policies (policy performance indices). In most Bayesian
	approaches to such advice, relatively few of the model parameters
	used can be treated as uncertain, and deterministic assumptions about
	population dynamics are required; this can bias the degree of certainty
	and estimates of policy performance indices. We reformulate a Bayesian
	approach that uses the sampling/importance resampling algorithm to
	improve estimates of policy performance indices; it extends the number
	of parameters that can be treated as uncertain, does not require
	deterministic assumptions about population dynamics, and can use
	any of the types of fishery assessment models and data. Application
	of the approach to New Zealand's western stock of hoki (Macruronus
	novaezelandiae) shows that the use of Bayesian prior information
	for parameters such as the constant of proportionality for acoustic
	survey abundance indices can enhance management advice by reducing
	uncertainty in current stock size estimates; it also suggests that
	assuming historic recruitment is deterministic can create large negative
	biases (e.g., 26%) in estimates of biological and economic risks
	of alternative harvesting policies and that a stochastic recruitment
	assumption can be more appropriate.},

	were required to estimate the model, such as the fraction of harvested

	Intercensal emigration and differential completeness of census enumeration

	represent important sources of bias for the estimation of intercensal

	errors associated with them. Life expectancy at birth estimated for
	the 1979-1989 intercensal period is 61.4 years for males and 63.2

	age distribution and stationary population assumption, changes to
	male or female harvest, stochastic effects (i. e., random fluctuations
	in recruitment and survival), and sampling efforts influenced SAK
	estimation. When the simulated population had a stable age distribution
	and l > 1, the SAK model underestimated abundance. Conversely, when
	l < 1, the SAK overestimated abundance. When changes to male harvest
	were introduced, SAK estimates were opposite the true population
	trend. In contrast, SAK estimates were robust to changes in female
	harvest rates. Stochastic effects caused SAK estimates to fluctuate
	about their equilibrium abundance, but the effect dampened as the
	size of the surveyed population increased. When we considered both
	stochastic effects and sampling error at a deer management unit scale
	the resultant abundance estimates were within ± 121.9% of the true
	population level 95% of the time. These combined results demonstrate
	extreme sensitivity to model violations and scale of analysis. Without
	changes to model formulation, the SAK model will be biased when l
	neq 1. Furthermore, any factor that alters the male harvest rate,
	such as changes to regulations or changes in hunter attitudes, will
	bias population estimates. Sex-age-kill estimates may be precise
	at large spatial scales, such as the state level, but less so at
	the individual management unit level. Alternative models, such as
	statistical age-at-harvest models, which require similar data types,
	might allow for more robust, broad-scale demographic assessments.},

  review = {*INTRODUCTION*
	
	- SAK model requires estimates of male mortality, ratios of male:female,
	female:juvenile. These can be obtained by invoking the assumption
	of a stable-stationary population and looking at age composition
	of current population.
	
	- Study robustness of SAK model to violations of stable-stationary
	population assumption, natural variation in survival and recruitment
	rates, changes in harvest recording practices, etc.
	
	
	*METHODS*
	
	- Deterministic simulation:
	
	-- Generated hypothetical 2-sex populations with non-constant growth
	rates (lambda < 1 and lambda > 1; n(t+1) = n(t)*lambda) to test for
	impact of non-stationary population.
	
	-- Assume no measurement error.
	
	- Stochastic simulation:
	
	-- Modeled number harvested as binomial process; separate parameters
	for each age-sex class.
	
	-- Modeled n(t+1) as a binomial with parameters (n(t)-harvested(t),
	s), where s is prob of surviving natural causes of death.
	
	-- Modeled new births as a Poisson random variable with mean determined
	by number of females and fertility rates assumed to be prevailing.
	
	-- Induced correlation between survival and fertility by drawing u_k
	from Uniform(-0.2, 0.2) and mulitplying both survival and fertility
	by (1+u_k) for year k. New draw in each year of the projection.
	
	-- Assume no measurement error.
	
	
	*RESULTS*
	
	- Deterministic simulations:
	
	-- Violation of stable population assumption: When population non-stationary,
	SAK estimates too low when lambda > 1 and too high when lambda <
	1.
	
	-- Violation of constant harvest ratios: Increases/decreases in male
	harvest caused spikes in SAK estimates, albeit in same direction
	as actual population change, i.e., an over correction (Fig 2). Increase
	in female harvest caused a less severe over correction (Fig 3).
	
	- Stochastic simulations:
	
	-- Stochastic variation in the births, harvest numbers and survivor
	numbers resulted in substantial fluctuations in SAK estimates by
	year. Error decreased as population size increased; need very large
	populations before error in SAK estimates becomes trivial.
	
	
	*DISCUSSION*
	
	- Statistical age-at-harvest method of Gove et al. (2002) more robust.
	Does not require stable-stationary assumption.},

  abstract = {Constrained by estimated population totals and observed totals of
	births and deaths, estimates of age-structures from inverse projection
	have been widely used in historical demography. Back Projection attempted,
	by using hypothetical constraints on net-migration, to estimate the
	population totals as well, and has been used to derive `censuses'
	for England from 1541 to 1871. A wider formulation, called Generalised
	Inverse Projection, is proposed in this paper, which replaces back-projection
	and establishes its relation to Inverse Projection more clearly.
	Under the same assumptions as back projection, but using the new
	method, the estimates for England are virtually unchanged. This new
	method is capable of performing population projections, subject to
	a wide variety of hypothetical and empirical constraints, for contemporary
	as well as historical data.},

	a number of parametric models have been proposed. Recently, the fertility
	pattern in developed countries exhibits a deviation from the classical
	one. Recent data sets of United Kingdom, Ireland and US show distortions
	in terms of a bulge in fertility rates of younger women. Furthermore
	in countries with distorted fertility, the pattern of first births
	also exhibits an intense hump in younger ages, stronger than that
	of the total fertility pattern. This heterogeneity indicated by the
	recent fertility distributions of European countries and the US might
	be related to marital status, religion, educational level and differences
	in social and economic conditions. Additionally in the United States
	this heterogeneity in fertility patterns might be related to ethnic
	differences in the timing and the number of births. As expected,
	the existing models are unable to describe the new shape of the fertility
	pattern and therefore the use of more appropriate representations
	is required. In this paper, a new flexible model for describing both
	the old and the new patterns of fertility is proposed. In order to
	evaluate the adequacy of the model, we fit it to a variety of empirical
	fertility schedule.},

  abstract = {In a recent paper titled Requiem for the Net Migrant Andrei Rogers
	persuasively argues for the use of a multiregional perspective rather
	than a uniregional one in measuring and projecting the dynamics of
	internal migration. In particular, he highlights the deficiencies
	of using net migration rates in population projections, giving illustrations
	of the very large differences that can occur if constant net migration
	rates are assumed versus fixed interregional transition probabilities.
	Net migration rates are conceptually unsound because their denominators
	are not true at-risk populations. Fixed interregional transition
	probabilities, however, are inconsistent with a sound behavioral
	representation of migration system dynamics. Whereas such stationary
	Markov models posit a role for shifting origin region populations,
	they do not embed the assumptions intrinsic to gravity or opportunity
	model concepts about the role of changing destination region populations.
	This paper explores alternative, more behaviorally pleasing interregional
	models that posit a role for shifting destination populations in
	altering the attractiveness of migration alternatives. Density-dampened,
	destination-population-weighted transition probability structures
	are explored. The importance of modeling intraregional migration
	separately from nonmovement is stressed.},

  pages = {1244--1255},

  abstract = {Deterministic simulation models are used in many areas of science,
	engineering, and policy making. Typically, these are complex models
	that attempt to capture underlying mechanisms in considerable detail,
	and they have many user-specified inputs. The inputs are often specified
	by some form of trial-and-error approach in which plausible values
	are postulated, the corresponding outputs inspected, and the inputs
	modified until plausible outputs are obtained. Here we address the
	issue of more formal inference for such models. A probabilistic approach,
	called Bayesian synthesis, was shown to suffer from the Borel paradox,
	according to which the results can depend on the parameterization
	of the model. We propose a modified approach, called Bayesian melding,
	which takes into full account information and uncertainty about both
	inputs and outputs to the model, while avoiding the Borel paradox.
	This is done by recognizing the existence of two priors, one implicit
	and one explicit, on each input and output; these are combined via
	logarithmic pooling. Bayesian melding is then standard Bayesian inference
	with the pooled prior on inputs, and is implemented here by posterior
	simulation using the sampling-importance-resampling (SIR) algorithm.
	We develop this initially for invertible models, and then extend
	it to the more difficult and more common case of noninvertible models.
	We illustrate the methodology using a number of examples. Simulation
	studies show that the method outperforms a simpler Bayesian approach
	in terms of mean squared error. A number of open research problems
	are discussed.},

  abstract = {Inferential approaches based on the synthesis of diverse sources of
	evidence are increasingly employed in epidemiology as a means of
	exploiting all available information, perhaps from studies of differing
	designs. The application of the synthesis of evidence to real world
	problems generally leads to the formulation of probability models
	which are highly complex and for which there is a clear need for
	a well-defined iterative process of model criticism. This process
	should include an appraisal of model fit and the detection of inconsistent
	or conflicting evidence. The latter is especially relevant as, typically,
	multiple sources of data provide information on the same parameter.
	Detected conflicts need then to be resolved. We present a case-study
	of the detection and resolution of conflicting evidence, using as
	an illustration the estimation of the prevalence of human immunodeficiency
	virus (HIV) infection in England and Wales. We employ a Bayesian
	model to synthesize routine surveillance and survey data. The population
	aged 15-44 years is divided into mutually exclusive exposure groups.
	In each group g, we simultaneously estimate the proportion of the
	total population belonging to the group (rg), the proportion of individuals
	infected with HIV (pg) and the proportion of HIV positive individuals
	who are diagnosed (dg). The total number of HIV infections, both
	diagnosed and undiagnosed, is then estimated as a function of the
	parameters rg, pg, and dg. Model fit is assessed by examining the
	posterior mean deviance. Identification of the data items to which
	the model exhibits a lack of fit leads to the detection of conflicting
	evidence, one example of which is a conflict between census data
	and survey data over the size of the female Sub-Saharan African born
	population. This conflict arises from a naive interpretation of the
	representativeness of the survey data and is resolved by using two
	approaches: exclusion of data and expansion of the model to accommodate
	the bias.},

	of a multiregional perspective in measuring and projecting the dynamics
	of internal migration flows, many scholars continue to adopt the
	uniregional perspective that is forced to focus on net migrants,
	a nonexistent category of individuals. Net migration models are misspecified
	because the rates that they use confound changing migration propensities
	with changing population stocks. Moreover, they obscure regularities
	in age profiles of migration and thereby further misspecify the spatial
	dynamics generating observed settlement patterns. Thus, the use of
	the net migration rate as the dependent variable in explanatory models
	of migration can produce a misspecification of the fundamental relationships
	that are the subject of inquiry. This paper considers deficiencies
	of the net migration concept and illustrates them with numerical
	examples.},

  abstract = {Harvest data constitute an important source of information on many
	white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations in North America.
	Many techniques and variations thereof have been developed for the
	analysis of such data, and preferred methods differ widely among
	management agencies and researchers. In this monograph, we catalog,
	evaluate, and compare a number of these techniques including Index-Removal,
	Catch Per Unit Effort, Population Reconstruction, Change-in-ratio,
	Life Table, Harvest Age Structure, Harvest Sex Ratio, Lang and Wood's
	"Pennsylvania" method, and Fraser's method. We critically examined
	characteristics such as input requirements, output produced, assumptions,
	accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and robustness. Comparative evaluations
	were based primarily on ability to identify and monitor trends in
	the Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge deer herd during the period
	1973-88. Over that timespan, the herd was apparently harvest-regulated
	and experienced several alternating periods of decline and stability.
	Index-Removal, Change-in-ratio, and Life Table Analysis proved least
	satisfactory in providing information about the reference herd, primarily
	because critical assumptions were not met. Harvest Age Structure
	and Harvest Sex Ratio analyses were more useful, but neither provided
	information sufficient for precise herd management. The importance
	of interpreting harvest age structure separately for males and females
	was emphasized. Reconstruction offered a logical and direct tool
	for population analysis although it was sensitive to varying harvest
	intensity and did not address current status unless combined with
	other techniques. Certain variations of the Catch Per Unit Effort
	approach were able to closely monitor trends in abundance with a
	minimum of data. The Lang-Wood and Fraser methods appeared to be
	less sensitive, precise, and robust than Reconstruction or Catch
	Per Unit Effort, but could serve as supplemental methods of analysis.
	We conclude by describing how trends in abundance, harvest, and effort
	might be indicative of a population's probable position on the growth
	curve. The relevance of such knowledge to "practical" deer management
	also is discussed.},

  review = {Presents a very general framework
	
	for state-space population models, expressed in terms of
	
	matrices. There are four key components, all depending on time, $t$:
	
	\begin{description}
	
	\item[$\vec{X}_t$] a state vector, dimension $d_X$: the underlying,
	perhaps
	
	unobservable state of the population.
	
	\item[$\vec{Y}_t$] an observation vector, dimension $d_Y$: observable,
	
	depends directly on $\vec{X}_t$.
	
	\item[$\vec{Z}_t$] a control vector, dimension $d_Z$: observable,
	not
	
	directly dependent on $\vec{X}_t$. In fact, $\vec{X}_t$ may depend
	
	on $\vec{Z}_t$.
	
	\item[$\vec{\Theta}$] a parameter vector, dimension $d_\Theta$: unobservable.
	
	\end{description}
	
	The deterministic state-space model consists of two functional
	
	relationships which embody the temporal structure and observaion
	
	process:
	
	\begin{align*}
	
	\vec{X}_t &= \vec{F}(\vec{X}_{t-1},\vec{Z}_t,\vec{\Theta}) \\
	
	\vec{Y}_t &= \vec{G}(\vec{X}_t,\vec{Z}_t,\vec{\Theta}).
	
	\end{align*}
	
	In the stochastic model, deterministic functions are replaced by
	
	probabilities:
	
	\begin{align*}
	
	&\Pr(\vec{X}_0 \cond \vec{Z}_0, \vec{\Theta}) \\
	
	&\Pr(\vec{X}_t \cond \vec{X}_{t-1} \vec{Z}_{t}, \vec{\Theta}),\ t>0
	
	\\
	
	&\Pr(\vec{Y}_t \cond \vec{X}_t,\vec{Z}_t,\vec{\Theta}).
	
	\end{align*}
	
	The normal model is a special case; with $\vec{\delta}_t \sim
	
	\dNorm_{d_x}(\vec{0}, \vec{U}(\vec{Z}_t,\vec{\Theta}))$ and
	
	$\vec{\epsilon}_t \sim \dNorm_{d_T}(\vec{0}, \vec{V}(\vec{Z}_t,\vec{\Theta}))$:
	
	\begin{align*}
	
	\vec{X}_t &= \vec{F}(\vec{X}_{t-1},\vec{Z}_t,\vec{\Theta}_t) +
	
	\vec{\delta}_t \\
	
	\vec{Y}_t &= \vec{G}(\vec{X}_t,\vec{Z}_t,\vec{\Theta}_t) + \vec{\epsilon}_t.
	
	\end{align*}
	
	In the normal, linear model, $\vec{F}$ and $\vec{G}$ are further
	
	constrained to be linear functions.
	
	
	Several methods of inference are discussed. In principle,
	
	$\vec{\Theta}$ can be estimated from the integrated likelihood:
	
	\begin{equation*}
	
	\int_{\vec{X}^T} L(\vec{Y}^T \cond \vec{X}^T, \vec{Z}^T,
	
	\vec{\Theta}) L(\vec{X}^T \cond \vec{Z}^T, \vec{\Theta}^T) \ud \vec{X}^T
	
	
	\end{equation*}
	
	where $\vec{X}^T$ represents $\{\vec{X}_t; t = 0, \ldots,
	
	T\}$. Frequentist and Bayesian methods are discussed. For example,
	under
	
	the normal model the Kalman filter (linear) and extended Kalman filter
	
	(non-linear) can be used to estimate $\vec{\Theta}$ from $\vec{Y}^T$
	
	and $\vec{Z}^T$ alone, but otherwise this may be intractable. A
	
	Bayesian approach in which inference is based on the joint posterior
	
	$\Pr(\vec{\Theta},\vec{X}^T \cond \vec{Y}^T,\vec{Z}^T)$ is suggested.
	
	
	An example of the model formulation is given when catch-at-age data
	
	and some supplementary information is available. Technical challenges
	
	relating to estimation of many parameters is also discussed, and
	
	identifiability issues are mentioned.},

	- Common approach to incorporating migration in CCMP projections is
	to construct a rate from net flow divided by population of area under
	study.
	
	- However, this is not a proper rate; the population under study is
	not at risk of "net migration" because "net migrants" do not exist.
	
	- Better to split into two rates: one for in-migrants with denominator
	the pop of everywhere buy the area under study and one for out-migrants
	with denominator the area under study.},

  abstract = {Net migration has been widely criticized as a theoretical concept
	and as a measure of population movement. Many of these criticisms
	are valid: net migration reflects a residual rather than a true migration
	process, it often masks large gross migration flows, it cannot account
	for differences in the characteristics of origin and destination
	populations, it cannot be used for rates in a probabilistic sense,
	and it can lead to misspecified causal models and unrealistic population
	projections. However, we believe there are purposes for which net
	migration is very useful, especially for analyses of small areas:
	1) It provides a summary measure of one component of population change;
	2) It can be used when gross migration data are unavailable or unreliable;
	and 3) It provides a low-cost alternative to the use of gross migration
	data. In this paper we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of net
	migration and provide several examples of how it can be useful for
	population estimation, forecasting, and analysis.},

	random errors; (2) the elements of the transition matrix represent
	probabilities, rather than rates; and (3) the transition matrices
	are random variables. The mean of each process is shown to reproduce
	the deterministic process, while the variance can be expressed as
	the weighted sum of one-step conditional variances. For the second
	model, these "innovation variances" will be small for large populations,
	while for the first and third models their size will depend on the
	observed variability of, respectively, prediction errors and vital
	rates. Since it is known empirically that both the latter are quite
	variable, these models could be expected to yield relatively high
	prediction variances, and this expectation is confirmed by a numerical
	example. The first model seems unsatisfactory as demographic theory,
	while the second does not account for the observed imprecision of
	population projections. The third model does, however, seem to provide
	a satisfactory method of estimating prediction variances of population
	projections.},

	defined groups, and changes substantially and inversely with the
	group average length of life. We show that variance in length of
	life is inversely related to the Gompertz slope of log mortality
	through age, and we reveal its relationship to variance in a multiplicative
	frailty index. Our findings bear a variety of implications for modeling
	and forecasting mortality. In particular, we examine how the assumption
	of proportional hazards fails to account adequately for differences
	in subgroup variance, and we discuss how several common forecasting
	models treat the variance in the temporal dimension.},

	- Previous attempts at using Bayesian methods for ring-recovery data
	suggested it was infeasible due to computational difficulties.
	
	- Using max likelihood not optimal since "arbitrary" constraints had
	to be imposed to make parameters identifiable.
	
	
	*DATA*
	
	- Ring-recovery data for male mallards (1963--1971) and herring gull
	(1934--1939).
	
	- Birds ringed as nestlings and reported at death. Time of ringing
	and time of recovery used to determine age at death.
	
	
	*METHODS, RESULTS*
	
	- Multinomial likelihood of probability of recovery at age x for each
	cohort, parameterized by age-year specific survival proportions and
	probability of recovery given death.
	
	- Estimation by MCMC/Gibbs. Uniform prior assumed on all parameters.
	
	- Several models considered; recovery, first year survival and adult
	survival are or are not allowed to depend on time and age, for example.
	
	
	-- Goodness of fit assessed using "Bayesian p-values" calculated from
	a chi-square like statistic.
	
	-- Also use graphics to assess fit. E.g., plotting observed age-year
	specific recovery counts to distribution predicted by sample from
	posterior of parameters.
	
	- Sensitivity to prior tested by re-sampling from posterior sample
	using weights proportional to old and new prior.
	
	- Posterior distributions of survival probabilities for older ages
	look like the priors---not much information about them. Tested sensitivity
	by re-estimating but with survival for later ages constrained to
	be equal.
	
	- Simulation studies used to compare Bayesian and max likelihood estimation
	in a toy version of this problem.
	
	-- With smaller samples, Bayesian analysis gave more realistic, larger
	standard errors.
	
	-- Orthogonalization attempted using assumption of multivariate normality
	and the Cholesky decomposition.},

	fertility, first marriage, divorce, remarriage, and leaving the parental
	home. The method has been successfully tested by fittings to 180
	reliable observed demographic schedules in various countries and
	periods, and to nearly 10,000simulated schedules with various combinations
	of possible values (including the extremes) of a and ß. Our proposed
	method that uses median age and interquartile range instead of a
	and ß as input is useful in the population and family household projections.
	It releases the traditionalunrealistic assumption in population projections
	that the curve of the fertility schedule moves to the right or left
	in a parallel way. Instead, using our proposed method, one can assume
	that the demographic events would be delayed or advanced, while the
	curve becomes more spread or more concentrated, or, more specifically,
	assume that young people delay the events more than the older persons
	do, or vice versa. Our proposed method is also useful to formulate
	assumptions on future demographic trends for purposes of policy analysisand
	planning. It can be used to indirectly estimate demographic schedules
	when the detailed age-specific data are not currently available,
	which is useful for developing countries and sub-region studies in
	developed countries. A crucial point for a successful application
	of the method is that the standard schedule chosen can capture the
	general pattern of the demographic process in the population under
	study.},
